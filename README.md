<h2 align="left">Sales Prediction Using Multiple Regression</h2>

### Description:-

In this project ,I have built and evaluated **multiple linear regression models** using Python. I have used scikit-learn to calculate the regression, while using pandas for data management and seaborn for data visualization. The dataset for this project consists of the very popular [Advertising](%28https://www.kaggle.com/ishaanv/ISLR-Auto#Advertising.csv%29) dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as banners, electronic billboards, and others.

### Key Task : 
 - Built univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn .
 - Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn .
 - Evaluated model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE .
 - Performed Model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques.
